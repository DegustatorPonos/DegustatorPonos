## Hello. My name is Physick.

I am a student and am working as a software engineer. Current directions: embedded Linux and web-development.  
At the same time I'm really passionate about gamedev and currently really slowly developing a strategy game called "New Religion" as a first touch of a custom MonoGame extention. 

## I've worked with:
- C# (.NET, ASP.NET, WinForms, Monogame) - main tool I use for backend. It feels good to develop with and works decently good and reliable.
- JavaScript (in combination with HTML+CSS) - Sometimes you have to do things you are not a fan of. JS is one of those.
- Bash - I've done some things with this such as a IO event handler and API with NGINX and never was the development so miserable.

## I'm currently learning:
- Golang - The language I tried and it felt good. Currently there is a project I write to learn it beyond basic operations and MVC.
- C - Its a must-have and I gave no idea how I haven't seriously touched it before.
